## The Cars of the World 1970 - 1982

This is an analysis of cars of various national origins. This analysis will focus on identifying factors influencing fuel efficiency and stereoyping cars.

## Introduction 

This dataset embodies a critical point in automotive history where due to the 1973 Oil Crisis and strengthening air quality controls american car makers were forced to downsize and promote efficiency. Exploring this period might offer relevant information to the current task of emissions reduction. We might also learn about the historical transformation these cars underwent.  

The techinques of analysis used are linear regression and k means clustering. First, we will use linear regression to try and predict fuel efficiency of cars from the qualities described by the data set. Then, we will use kmeans clustering to create car stereoypes and examine what composes them.

We did this to solve the problem. We concluded that...

## Modelling

Here are some more details about the machine learning approach, and why this was deemed appropriate for the dataset. 

The model might involve optimizing some quantity. You can include snippets of code if it is helpful to explain things.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import ExtraTreesClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
X, y = make_classification(n_features=4, random_state=0)
clf = ExtraTreesClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=0)
clf.fit(X, y)
clf.predict([[0, 0, 0, 0]])
```

This is how the method was developed.
